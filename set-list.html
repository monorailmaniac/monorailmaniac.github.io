</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Monorail Set List</h1>
<p>The monorail system consisted of three traditional sets (those complete with trains, minifigures, and stations), two track expansion kits, and two service packs. The system lasted from 1987-1994 and spanned three three themes - Futuron, Airport, and Unitron. A brief description and review of each set will be included here.</p>
<h2>6990 Futuron Monorail (released 1987)</h2>
<p>This 715 piece set is the Futuron theme's flagship. The set features two detailed bases, a play feature rich train, and various other accessories.</p>
<p>The Futuron monorail train design is considered by many to be the best amongst the three official trains. This monorail sports seating for three, storage for a skiff, removable cargo container, and a unique removable battery box. The removable containers can be hauled by a small cargo ship or handled by machinery at either of the two included bases. The train has an angular design which fit perfectly with the rest of the Futuron theme. Perhaps the most striking feature is the insulator-like protrusions on the front circled by hoses. The motor decoration is basic with a pair of trans-dark blue 1x1 round plates and a 2x2 dish. This set was the only large set to include a motor with short couplers (the other short coupler set being a service pack).</p>
<p>This set's layout is a basic loop with hill. Each station has a stop/go switch, but what really makes this layout stand out is the trackside equipment. There are two track-mounted dishes and a track mounted scanner loop. This is the only set to use the studs on the side of the track to attach trackside equipment.</p>
<p>Each base included with the set includes a significant play feature. Half of the dome base rotates to move a sled into place beside the track. This sled can hold one of the train's removable containers. The raised base includes an elevator which is also designed to hold a container. Various control panels and other printed bricks compliment the greebles on both bases to round out the aesthetic. The set also includes five minifigures and a small cargo spaceship to haul containers around.</p>
<p>As a space builder this is my favorite monorail set. The train is as cool as a spaceship - it hauls a scooter, cargo, and figs. The base buildings are interesting and interactive. The set oozes character from the train to the buildings to the trackside equipment. I highly recommend everyone peruse <a href="https://lego.brickinstructions.com/lego_instructions/set/6990/Monorail_Transport_System" target="_blank">the instructions</a> if not outright buy the set.</p>
<h2>5039 Monorail Stop/Reverse Switch Service Pack (released 1987)</h2>
<p>This 3 piece service pack provided a way to add additional stops to a monorail layout. The set includes the stop/go piece, a 2x2 round brick, and a 2x2 printed arrow tile. This assembly matches the switches as used in set 6990. The service pack was the only monorail set released in a bag.</p>
<h2>6921 Monorail Accessory Track (released 1988)</h2>
<p>The 46 piece monorail accessory track set was the first opportunity for owners of set 6990 to dramatically increase their layout size. The set featured additional straight track, curves, and supports with two different heights. This expansion included a insert suggesting various layout designs one could build when combining the kit with 6990. Even the back of the box visualized a layout when combined with 6990. Another interesting box detail was the inclusion of a ghostly outline of a train on the track - this would not be seen again.</p>
<p>An interesting aside is that in <a href="https://buildingdebates.wordpress.com/2017/04/29/bjarne-tveskov/" target="_blank">an interview with Building Debates</a> former Lego designer Bjarne Panduro Tveskov mentioned writing software for the Sinclair QL to simulate track layouts combining 6990 and 6921.</p>
<h2>5040 Monorail 9V Motor (released 1988)</h2>
<p>5040 is the only single piece service pack released specifically for the monorail system and the only way to acquire a motor outside one of the larger sets. This motor had short couplings, just like the one included in 6990.</p>
<p>This service pack seems like it was intended to allow owners of a set to replace a damaged motor rather than add a second train to their layout. I believe this because a battery box and cable would also have to be bought separately for the motor to be used in a second train. Also, since the monorail cars were not available separately the existing train would need to be split up to make a train for the new motor.</p>
<h2>6399 Airport Shuttle (released 1990)</h2>
<p>The 728 piece Airport Shuttle is the largest monorail set by both sheer part count and by monorail element count. This behemouth is also the only non-space entry in the monorail portfolio. It includes the only official monorail engine cover ever released.</p>
<p>The train is a straightforward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_mover" target="_blank">people mover</a> with seating for five plus two operators. The passenger cabins are separated from the driver cabs by a piece of glass. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gull-wing_door" target="_blank">Gull-wing doors</a> provide access to the passenger cabins, but this does require the train to face a specific direction so the figs can reach the platforms. Perhaps the most interesting (and I think unfortunate) design choice is the battery box being integrated directly into the train itself. Thus, changing the battery requires disassembling one of the train cars. The engine cover works well to blend the train together seemlessly and adds some vent detail.</p>
<p>The set includes two stations - one intended to be near the airport terminal and the other in downtown. Both stations include raised platforms with ticket machines as well as signals for the monorail. The airport station conveniently includes seating, a flight schedule, and luggage storage bins. A beautifully designed "T" built into the station roof mirrors the logo sported by the train. There is a dropoff location where taxis can deposit passengers for the station or continue on to the airport. A payphone across the street from the station is likely to confuse those born after the year 2000.</p>
<p>The downtown station is raised high above a track running below. It includes a flight schedule, airport map, and a few seats. It's a hike to get up to! A hamburger stand underneath it provides a place for busy travelers to grab a snack. A few streetlights mounted underneath the station are a nice touch.</p>
<p>I'm a space guy so this review may be biased, sorry all you Town and City folks! Despite being large, I don't find this set particularly exciting. It seems the part budget was spent on including a large amount of track rather than maximizing play features. There are some nice details, such as the ticket machines and lights, but there's not much for the minifigs to do. They can grab a hamburger, wait at the station, and ride the train. That probably excites some people, but the set really seems like it needs other Town or Airport sets for a fun experience. The set is a great monorail parts pack, but it's the last monorail I would set up if I wanted to sit down and have some fun.</p>
<h2>6347 Monorail Accessory Track (released 1991)</h2>
<p>The second track expansion kit was the first time monorail turnouts were made available. This 54 piece kit included a left and right turnout, two straights, curves, and stanchions. The set included an insert showing a few layouts that could be made by combining the kit with 6990 or 6399. The sides of the box showed layouts with both sets as well.</p>
<h2>6991 Monorail Transport Base (released 1994)</h2>
<p>The 555 piece monorail transport base is the last entry in the monorail system and the flagship Unitron base. It includes a complex track layout, three stations, and numerous cool play features. It is a fitting end to the monorail line (pun intended).</p>
<p>The train is unique in that it does not have a permanent cab. Rather, the train hauls two Unitron spaceships (or perhaps just spaceship cockpits - depends on your imagination) which double as cabs for the train. The battery box is mounted directly on the car base, but the train does not require significant disassembly to remove it. There are various Unitron-style greebles, but the train design does seem a little sparse. The cars are designed to allow the spaceships to slide off the end (more on that in a bit).</p>
<p>The track layout includes a loop at 10-brick height. Two spurs diverge from the loop. Both turn inside the loop before one soars above the loop and the other drops below it. This is the only large monorail set to include turnouts. One spur ends atop a control center built on a mountain or rocky pillar. Here the spaceship on the train is pushed onto a platform and a trackside mechanism automatically reverses the train. The other spur ends at ground level where a truck can be placed to receive the spaceship off the train before it is reversed by a stop/go track.</p>
<p>The main station is built on a raised baseplate. It has a few neat features. A satellite dish on an axle is turned by the train when it passes via a wheel placed at a strategic level. The base also features an arm which can swing between train cars to carry a spaceship from one end of the train to another.</p>
<p>Three Unitron figs and a Spyrius droid were included to man the set. A truck capable of hauling a spaceship was also included. It sported a detachable "cab" that could double as a skiff.</p>
<p>Overall this is my second favorite full monorail set. It shows off quite a few cool techniques including the mountaintop automatic monorail reverser, the train-to-ground transfer mechanism, the train-to-truck transfer mechanism, and the rotating satellite dish. The set has the most interesting layout of any official monorail set. It also boasts more play features than 6399. However, the set feels more anemic than 6990. While it sports quite a few greebles, they're less visually coherent than those found on the older set. Many greebles are simply antennas and satellite dishes. The train exemplefies the emphasis on engineering over aesthetic as the ingenious unloading mechanism is paired with a scantly decorated battery box and motor while the other train car sports what appears to be a spaceship engine affixed permanently to the car. I encourage any collector to review this set and seriously consider purchasing it as it is fun to play with despite its minor flaws.</p>
