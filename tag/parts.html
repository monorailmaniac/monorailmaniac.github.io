</footer><!-- /.post-info --><h1>Monorail Element Info</h1>
<p>The core monorail system is comprised of track and train elements. I consider the 9V system (battery box, cables, and accessories) as its elements are usable outside of monorail. This list details the various monorail elements.</p>
<h2>Train elements</h2>
<p>These elements are needed to assemble an official monorail train.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=bb1171c01#T=S&amp;C=11&amp;O={%22color%22:11,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Monorail Wheel on Axle (bb1171c01)</a> - Wheelset mounted on metal axle. The axle is too small for a minifig to hold. Two of these axles are inserted into the bogie to hold a train car and allow it to move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2686#T=S&amp;C=11&amp;O={%22color%22:11,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Monorail Bogie (2686)</a> - The bogie is the frame which holds the wheels. It is combined with a bracket (fork) to allow the wheels to move independent of the train car frame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2697#T=S&amp;C=11&amp;O={%22color%22:11,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Monorail Bracket/Pivot/Fork</a> - A U-shaped piece with clips on the ends an a Technic half-height pin on top. This element attaches the train car base to the bogie and allows for movement of the bogie back and forth as well as tilt up and down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2687#T=S&amp;C=11&amp;O={%22color%22:11,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Monorail Base (Train Car Frame)</a> - The body on which a train car can be assembled. One end has an attachment point for a bogie (fork) and the other has a coupler designed to attach to a monorail motor coupler. The base is 4x20 studs in size and has a 2x2 section raised one plate high with a central hole starting 4 studs back and 1 stud in where the bogie's fork attaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monorail Coupler <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2685a#T=S&amp;C=11&amp;O={%22color%22:11,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Short (2685a)</a>/<a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2685b#T=S&amp;C=11&amp;O={%22color%22:11,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Long (2685b)</a> - A bent U-shaped coupler with clips on the both ends and a groove in the center. This element serves to couple a motor with a car. The end clips provide vertical motion to the car while the groove allows the car side-to-side motion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monorail Motor <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2684c01a#T=S&amp;O={%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">with Short Couplings (2684c01a)</a>/<a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2684c01b#T=S&amp;C=1&amp;O={%22color%22:1,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">with Long Couplings (2684c01b)</a> - The 9V motor which drives the train. It has a coupler on either end so it can attach two cars. It has a cylindrical body with cutout sides. The body curve does not match any standard Lego cylinder. There is a 2x2 square of four studs on top and two 2x2 stud square protrusions each facing one coupler. One of the 2x2 side protrusions has metal contacts for connecting the 9V system. The motor has four wheels. A rocker switch on the bottom can protrude from either or both sides of the motor. When the rocker is centered the motor does not move. The motor always moves to the right of the direction in which the rocker switch protrudes. That is, if you are facing the motor and the switch is pushed towards you the motor will begin moving to the left.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2619#T=S&amp;C=5&amp;O={%22color%22:5,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Monorail Motor Cover (2619)</a> - Generally square cover. Covers almost the entire motor, but leaves the couplers, rocker switch, and both 2x2 side protrusions exposed. A 2x8 line of studs longways runs atop the cover. Both top sides of the cover are recessed by 1 plate and have a 3x4 set of studs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Track elements</h2>
<p>These elements provide a surface for the train to run on and have a rack the motor engages for movement. All track elements have a 1x2 section on either side of the end with which to connect other track pieces. All track elements also have a 1x2 antistud section on either end and a 2x2 antistud section located approximately in the center of the piece to attach stanchions/supports. The flat surface on every track element is 1 LDU higher than a stack of platse would be.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2670#T=S&amp;C=9&amp;O={%22color%22:9,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Monorail Short Straight (2670)</a> - A straight piece of track which can fit a monorail motor on top. This is the smallest monorail track piece at only 8 studs long.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2671#T=S&amp;C=9&amp;O={%22color%22:9,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Monorail Long Straight (2671)</a> - A straight piece of track which can fit a monorail motor and car on top. This is the longest straight piece of track available with a length of 32 studs (equivalent to four short straight pieces).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2677#T=S&amp;C=9&amp;O={%22color%22:9,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Monorail Ramp Lower (2677)</a> - A straight piece of track which curves upwards. The upper end has an angled slope which only mates with the monorail ramp upper. Has a length of 32 studs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2678#T=S&amp;C=9&amp;O={%22color%22:9,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Monorail Ramp Upper (2678)</a> - A straight piece of track which curves from a slope to level. The lower end has an angled slope which only mates with the monorail ramp lower. Has a length of 32 studs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2772c01#T=S&amp;C=9&amp;O={%22color%22:9,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Monorail Stop/Go Switch (2772c01)</a> - A straight piece of track which has a stop/go element attached. Has a length of 16 studs. The stop/go element is placed 2 studs back from one end of the track. The stop/go element is 4x12 studs in size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monorail Turnout <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2889#T=S&amp;C=9&amp;O={%22color%22:9,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Right (2889)</a>/<a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2890#T=S&amp;C=9&amp;O={%22color%22:9,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Left (2890)</a> - A 32 stud long element which allows trains to diverge from the straight track. The divergent end has another unique shape so it can only mate with out turnout pieces or half curves. The track is designed to automatically align the switch if a train approaches from a direction which is not set. A manually throw is also included for manipulating the turnout.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monorail Short Curve <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2891#T=S&amp;C=9&amp;O={%22color%22:9,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Right (2891)</a>/<a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2892#T=S&amp;C=9&amp;O={%22color%22:9,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Left (2892)</a> - A curve which is half the length of a regular large curve. One end has a special shape to only mate with other cruves or turnouts. Can be used to create an S-bend, a 90° turnout from a straight track, or a parallel track (depending with which element it is combined).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2672#T=S&amp;C=9&amp;O={%22color%22:9,%22iconly%22:0}" target="_blank">Monorail Large Curve (2672)</a> - A full 90° curve.</p>
